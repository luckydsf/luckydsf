- 👋 Hi, I’m @luckydsf.  I have over 25 years GIS map making, analysis, data creation, data transformation, application andweb development, project management and program management experience.  I am making a career change to get back to the technial aspects of GIS and am upgrading my skills through self-learning. 
- 👀 I’m interested in GIS: developing web applications, creating data transformations, analysis, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the wonderful world of open source using AWS, Node, Leaflet, QGIS, GeoServer, Python, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GIS projects that will help me improve my GIS skills and helping others is always a bonus!

My current project is  🔥 firealertmap.com 🔥:  a map which gathers specific data and provide a map showing current fire conditions and related information to aid users in gaining an understanding of the current environmental conditions to support vegetation management and wildfire prevention and suppression.
